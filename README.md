# FlockSimulation

Fly.cs is an implementation to simulate a crowd of flocking birds using a system of particles that follows a target. Forces involved in real flocking are taken into account in order to give the most accurate representation as possible. Specifically four factors (separation, alignment, cohesion and avoidance) have been applied in a weighted fashion to give more priority to some forces over others.
